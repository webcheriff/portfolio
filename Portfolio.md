### Checklist in Sheets

This is a checklist to the project to test the API of the educational application 'Yandex Prilavok'.

To test the four endpoints in the Yandex Counter API, I made a checklist using test design techniques - equivalence classes and boundary values.
According to the terms of the project, there was little time for testing, so it was a checklist, not a test case. And the use of EC and BV techniques allowed an optimal number of tests.
